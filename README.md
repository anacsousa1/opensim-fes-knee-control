# Control strategies for functional electrical stimulation (FES) knee movement in OpenSim

This work controls knee movement with four FES knee controllers (bang-bang, PID, PID-ILC and PID-extremum seeking). For a further description of materials, libraries and results, see the [tutorial](https://github.com/anacsousa1/opensim-fes-knee-control/blob/master/Tutorial.pdf).

The software was tested with Windows 10 Operating System, Matlab MathWorks R2017a, R2018b and R2019a and OpenSim 3.3.

# Software requirements
